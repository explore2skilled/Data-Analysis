# Data-Analysis project implemenatation on customer segmentation using alogorithm of K-Means Clustering .  
Hello !! My name is Rani Ojha , Technical Trainer facilitating online training on Technical Domain of Python , Machine Learning , Data Analysis through e-learning platform Explore Skilled . 

This project is based on analysis requirement of customer based industry to understand subdivison of market and its competition based on customer needs based on parameters of Gender , Age , Places , Income , Expenditure , Spending Capacity .
Clustering is a type of explorative data mining used in many application oriented areas such as machine learning, classification and pattern recognition.The algorithm is called k-means due to the fact that the letter k represents the number of clusters chosen.

The project is based on technical concepts of :
Python ( Using modules of Numpy , Pandas , Matplotlib) 
Machine Learning Algorithm ( K-means Clustering )
